# Deploying HuggingFace LLM on SageMaker Pipeline.

This SageMaker Pipeline definition creates a workflow that will:

Retrieve the Docker image URI for the HuggingFace Language Model (LLM).

Create a HuggingFaceModel instance with the specified role, image URI, and environment variables (model ID, GPU count, input/output lengths, batch processing limits, and access token).

Register the HuggingFaceModel for deployment through the RegisterModel step.

Configure the content types, response types, and instance types for inference.

Specify the model package group name and set the initial approval status to "PendingManualApproval".

Create the SageMaker Pipeline instance with the RegisterModel step and pipeline parameters.
