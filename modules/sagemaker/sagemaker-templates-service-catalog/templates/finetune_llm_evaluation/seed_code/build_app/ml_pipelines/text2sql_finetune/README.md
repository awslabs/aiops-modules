## CodeLLama Fine-tune ModelBuild Project Template

This is a sample code repository that demonstrates how the LLM CodeLlama can be fine-tuned with Amazon SageMaker pipelines.
The pipeline fine-tunes the model with the provided data. After training, the model will be evaluated and it the score exceeds a certain threshold, the model will be registered to SageMaker Model Registry.
